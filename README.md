<h1>JavaScript Lesson 2: Interactivity</h1>

<p>A web page can react or change according to user inputs and clicks. Let's explore one of the most common forms of interactivity--the button.</p>
<p>In order to create interacvity with a button, we need to know three things:</p>
<ul>
	<li>How to create a button using HTML.</li>
	<li>How to make the button recognize a click.</li>
	<li>How to tell the button what to do.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Button</h2>

<p>You can create a simple HTML button by typing: <code>&lt;button type=&quot;button&quot;&gt;Do Something!&lt;/button&gt;</code></p>
<p>You can <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/build-a-better-button-in-css3/">style this button</a> using CSS or use a <a href="http://css3buttongenerator.com/">button generator</a>. We're not covering that today.</p>

<p>You might give the button a class or an Id so you can control them later using JavaScript.</p>
